Climate Change Impact on Agriculture

Climate change poses a significant threat to agriculture in developing countries. Changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events are likely to disrupt crop production and livestock management. This can lead to food insecurity and economic instability in regions that are heavily dependent on agriculture.

Developing countries often lack the resources and infrastructure to adapt to these changes effectively. There is a need for international cooperation and investment in sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate the impact of climate change on these vulnerable communities.
